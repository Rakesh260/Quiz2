Architecture & Design Explanation

Project Overview

The Employee Data Project is a Django-based RESTful API that manages employee data, including departments, attendance, performance, and leave records. The backend is designed for scalability, security, and ease of use by integrating modern practices such as JWT authentication, pagination, and throttling.

Framework: 

Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)
Why Django?

Robust ORM

Built-in admin interface

Rapid development with batteries-included philosophy

Why DRF?

Simplifies API creation

Built-in support for authentication, permissions, and throttling

Easy serialization and schema generation


Modular App Design:

Each concern (models, serializers, views, pagination, throttling) is separated for clarity and maintainability.

App name: employeeapp for managing business logic.

Schema-related logic is isolated in a dedicated schema/ module.Schema-related logic is isolated in a dedicated schema/ module.

 Technologies Used:

Backend Framework - Django

API Toolkit -	Django REST Framework

Database - PostgreSQL

Authentication	- JWT (via SimpleJWT)

Documentation - DRF Schema + CoreAPI Docs

Security & Auth:

JWT Authentication: Used for stateless secure access using rest_framework_simplejwt.

Permissions: Restricted endpoints with IsAuthenticated.

Throttling: Applied per-user and anonymous limits (100/hour and 10/hour).

Pagination & Throttling

Used PageNumberPagination to return 5 items per page.

Implemented both user and anonymous throttling to prevent abuse.

Fake Data Generation:
 
A management command (generate_fake_data.py) is provided to populate test data for employees, attendance, and more using the Faker library.

Extensibility:
 
The current API design can be easily extended to support:

Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Employee)

Departmental analytics

Visualization dashboards
